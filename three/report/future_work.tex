\subsubsection{State space encoding}
It has shown that the state space encoding has improved the performance of the program. However, in order to run tests with four predators on one grid, a smarter encoding is necessary. With a smarter state space encoding, it will be possible to run the program with up to four predators and this research can be completed. The smarter state space encoding will also allow multiple experiments to be run on grids with three or more predators.
